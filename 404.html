<!-- This 404.html file is added to ensure proper routing for this Single Page Application (SPA) hosted on GitHub Pages. 
GitHub Pages does not natively support SPA routing and will return this file when a user navigates to a route that does not exist as a physical file or directory. By adding this file, we ensure that all unmatched routes are redirected here, allowing React Router to handle the route and display the correct page.
 This file is only for GitHub Pages SPA compatibility -->
